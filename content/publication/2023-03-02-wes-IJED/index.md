#### Objective

Ample evidence shows that transgender congruence is negatively associated with body dissatisfaction and disordered eating in the Western context; however, limited research has explored these relationships in non-Western populations (e.g., Chinese transgender adults). Moreover, to our knowledge, there has been no research describing disordered eating in Chinese transgender adults. Thus, this study aimed to explore group differences in and relationships between transgender congruence, body appreciation, body dissatisfaction, and disordered eating in Chinese transgender adults.


#### Methods

This study examined transgender congruence, body appreciation, body dissatisfaction, and disordered eating in a sample of Chinese transgender adults (*N* = 200). Chi-square, *F* tests, and correlation analyses were conducted to examine group differences and relationships between study variables.


#### Results

Of the transgender adults, 31.0% screened positive as probable eating disorder (ED) cases. There were no gender identity differences in the study variables. Transgender congruence was positively associated body appreciation (*r* = .40, *p* < .001) and negatively associated with body dissatisfaction (*r* = −.26, *p* < .001) and disordered eating (*r* = −.15, *p* = .031).


#### Discussion

Chinese transgender adults may be at high risk of EDs. Transgender congruence and body appreciation may serve a protective role in the context of eating pathology in Chinese transgender adults. Future research is needed to validate the observed relationships between transgender congruence, body appreciation, body dissatisfaction, and disordered eating in Chinese transgender adults.


#### Public Significance

Research on disordered eating and body image in Chinese transgender adults is limited. This study describes disordered eating and its relations with transgender congruence, body appreciation, and body dissatisfaction in Chinese transgender adults. Findings highlight the need for and implications of ED intervention in Chinese transgender adults.
