abstract: "Food intake has been shown to be related to several environmental factors including the presence of music. However, previous findings of the relationship between music and food intake are inconsistent. In the present study, a systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to quantitatively review the extent to which music is associated with food intake as well as to investigate potential moderators that might have contributed to the heterogeneity of the existing findings. Literature was searched on four databases (i.e., PsycINFO, Web of Science, PubMed, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses) and Google Scholar. Nine articles published from 1989 to 2020 met our inclusion criteria. A meta-analysis was carried out via a three-level random-effects model. The overall effect size (i.e., Hedges’ *g*) was 0.19 (95% Confidence Interval: −0.003, 0.386; *SE* = 0.10, *t* = 1.99, *p* = 0.054), indicating a marginally significant but small effect size. Body Mass Index (*F*(1, 21) = 5.11, *p* = 0.035) was found to significantly contribute to the heterogeneity of effect sizes, with larger positive effects of music on food intake for individuals with higher BMI. However, music-related features did not significantly moderate the relationship between music and food intake. More experimental studies are needed to update the current meta-analysis and get a better understanding of this topic.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: "Previous studies have identified multiple risk factors of eating disorders that are related to emotion regulation and coping strategies in the Western context. However, most of these studies failed to describe any kind of hierarchy or interaction between risk factors that co-occur. To address this knowledge gap, the present study investigated a broad range of risk factors from the perspective of emotion regulation and then used a decision tree classification method to screen for EDs among young women in China. Results showed that body image inflexibility, psychological distress, and body dissatisfaction were the primary classifiers for Chinese women at high risk of EDs."
