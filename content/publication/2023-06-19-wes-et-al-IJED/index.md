### Objective

We tested an integrated model of three prominent theories of disordered eating (tripartite influence theory, objectification theory, and social comparison theory) in a sample of older Chinese men and women.

### Method

Chinese older men (*n* = 270) and women (*n* = 160) completed questionnaires assessing the tripartite influence, objectification, and social comparison theories and thinness- and muscularity-oriented disordered eating. Two structural equation models were tested in Chinese older men and women.

### Results

The integrated model showed good model fit and described meaningful variance in thinness- and muscularity-oriented disordered eating in Chinese older men and women. Higher appearance pressures were uniquely related to higher muscularity-oriented disordered eating in men. Across both gender groups, higher thinness internalization was uniquely related to higher thinness- and muscularity-oriented disordered eating, and in women only, higher muscularity internalization was uniquely related to lower thinness-oriented disordered eating. In men, higher upward and downward body image comparisons were uniquely related to higher and lower, respectively, muscularity-oriented disordered eating. In women, higher upward body image comparisons were only uniquely related to higher muscularity-oriented disordered eating while higher downward body image comparisons were uniquely related to both outcomes. Higher body shame was uniquely related to higher thinness-oriented disordered eating across both groups and in men alone, higher body shame was also uniquely related to higher muscularity-oriented disordered eating.

### Discussion

Findings, which tested the integration of tripartite influence, objectification, and social comparison theories, inform the prevention and treatment of disordered eating in Chinese older populations.

### Public Significance

The present study is the first to describe theories of disordered eating (tripartite influence, objectification, and social comparison) in Chinese older adults. Findings suggested good model fit and the integrated models described meaningful variance in thinness- and muscularity-oriented disordered eating in Chinese older women and men. Findings extend existing theories of disordered eating and, pending further study, may inform theory-driven prevention and treatment approaches in Chinese older adults."
