### Objective

We aimed to explore the potential associations between screen use while eating and intuitive eating and disordered (thinness-oriented and muscularity-oriented) eating behaviors.

### Methods

Analyses included 600 Chinese adults (50% women; *M*<sub>age</sub> = 30.67, *SD* = 8.08) recruited online. The use of four major screen devices was captured, including cell phones, tablets, computers, and TVs. Three types of eating behaviors were examined, namely intuitive eating, thinness-oriented disordered eating, and muscularity-oriented disordered eating. Pearson correlation and hierarchical regression analyses were conducted separately for men and women to examine the sex-specific associations between screen use while eating and intuitive eating, thinness-oriented disordered eating, and muscularity-oriented disordered eating.

### Results

In both men and women, more screen use while eating was significantly associated with lower intuitive eating, higher thinness-oriented disordered eating, and higher muscularity-oriented disordered eating, above and beyond total screen time and social media use.

### Discussion

We found preliminary evidence for the significant links between screen use while eating and intuitive eating and disordered eating. Given the global increases in screen use, continued research is warranted to further explore the role of screen use while eating in the development and maintenance of intuitive eating and disordered eating.

### Public Significance

Much remains unknown regarding screen use while eating and eating behaviors. We found that in both Chinese men and women, more screen use while eating was significantly and uniquely associated with lower intuitive eating, higher thinness-oriented disordered eating, and higher muscularity-oriented disordered eating. Findings highlight the importance of incorporating screen use while eating in future research on intuitive eating and disordered eating.
