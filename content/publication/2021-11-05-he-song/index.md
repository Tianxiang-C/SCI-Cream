abstract: "Research on eating disorders (EDs) and body image disturbances has focused mostly on females from Western countries, and little is known about EDs in male populations in China, which is partially due to the lack of validated assessment measures. The current work aims to translate the Muscularity-Oriented Eating Test (MOET), Drive for Muscularity Scale (DMS) and Muscle Dysmorphic Disorder Inventory (MDDI) into Chinese and examine their psychometric properties. The factor structures, reliability and validity of the translated scales were examined with two samples: male university students (*n* = 295, M<SUB>age</SUB> = 18.92 years) and general adult men (*n* = 406, M<SUB>age</SUB> = 28.53 years). With confirmatory factor analyses, the original factor structures are replicated for the MOET, DMS and MDDI. The results also support the adequate internal consistency for both samples. Strong evidence of convergent and incremental validity for the three measures is also found in both samples. Overall, the three measures prove to be good instruments for use among Chinese male university students and general adult men."
