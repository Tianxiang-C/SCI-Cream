Recently, REN Yaoxiang, a graduate advisee in our lab,published a [paper](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40337-022-00545-6) as the first author  in the [Journal of Eating Disorders](https://jeatdisord.biomedcentral.com/) with LU Chaoyi, YANG Han,MA Qianyue and Dr. ZHOU Jianjun from the [School of Data Science](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/en) at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen) and [Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data](http://www.sribd.cn/en), and foreign collaborators Wesley R. BARNHART and Prof. HE Jinbo (corresponding author). This study was supported by a grant from the Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data.

Yaoxiang wrote her feelings about participating in the research: I was honored to join Prof. HE Jinbo's SCI-Cream lab during my first year of graduate school. The lab focuses on eating disorders, body image, eating behaviors, and media, which is very much in line with my interest in the mental health field. It was a valuable learning opportunity for me to participate in this eating disorder-related research and paper writing, and to be exposed to the cutting-edge research direction of machine learning methods in eating disorders. During the research and writing of the paper, from the discussing data analysis, to the formation of the first draft of the article, to the refinement over and over again, it was the result of the joint efforts with other article authors under the guidance of Prof. HE and Dr. ZHOU from Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data. In the SCI-Cream lab, we not only learn how to do research and write papers, but also feel the patience of Prof. HE. During the many revisions of the articles, Prof. HE helped us to face the difficulties more calmly in the academic and mental perspective and better adapt to the research life. Secondly, under the influence of Prof. HE's positive and cheerful attitude, our labmates support each other and have a great team atmosphere, which makes doing research fruitful and interesting, and is beneficial to our future study and research and work. Once again, I am glad and thankful to meet Prof. HE and my labmates in graduate school, and I believe I will continue my research and working career with this spirit of our lab.
