Congratulations to Yaoxiang for publishing her first research article, where she was the first author.

Recently, [REN Yaoxiang](https://sci-cream.netlify.app/author/ren-yaoxiang/), a graduate advisee in our lab,published a [paper](https://doi.org/10.1186/s40337-022-00545-6) as the first author  in the [Journal of Eating Disorders](https://jeatdisord.biomedcentral.com/) with LU Chaoyi, YANG Han,MA Qianyue and Dr. ZHOU Jianjun from the [School of Data Science](https://sds.cuhk.edu.cn/en) at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen) and [Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data](http://www.sribd.cn/en), and foreign collaborators [Wesley R. BARNHART](https://wrbresearch.wordpress.com/) and Prof. [HE Jinbo](https://sci-cream.netlify.app/author/he-jinbo/) (corresponding author). This study was supported by a grant from the Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data.

Yaoxiang wrote her feelings about participating in the research: 
>I was honored to join Prof. HE Jinbo's SCI-Cream lab during my first year of graduate school. The lab's research focuses on eating disorders, body image, eating behaviors, and media, all of which are topics that I'm interested in. Participating in this eating disorder-related study and paper writing provided me with a fantastic learning opportunity, as well as exposure to the cutting-edge research direction of machine learning methods in eating disorders. It was the result of joint efforts with other authors during the research and writing of the paper, from discussing data analysis to forming the first draft of the article, to refinement over and over again, all under the guidance of Prof. HE and Dr. ZHOU from Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data. We not only learn how to do research and produce papers at the SCI-Cream lab, but we also feel Prof. HE's patience. Throughout the various revisions of the article, Prof. HE assisted us in dealing with the challenges more calmly from an academic and mental standpoint, as well as better adapting to the research life. Second, our labmates encourage each other and have a terrific team spirit because of Prof. HE's optimistic and upbeat attitude, which makes research fruitful and fascinating, and is useful to our future study, research, and work. Once again, I am grateful to have met Prof. HE and my labmates during graduate studies, and I believe that I will continue my research and working career in our lab's spirit.
