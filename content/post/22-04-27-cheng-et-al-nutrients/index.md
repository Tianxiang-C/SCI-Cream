Congratulations to the advisees for their first publication.

Recently, CHENG Ziyue, a graduate student in the lab, as the first author of the article, together with undergraduate students GAO Xueyan and YANG Chengyang Yang, Polish collaborator Prof. [Anna BRYTEK-MATERA](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aFkxcPYAAAAJ&hl=en) and Prof. HE Jinbo He (corresponding author), published a joint [paper](https://doi.org/10.3390/nu14091761) in *Nutrients*.

Ziyue wrote her feelings about participating in the research: 
>When I first met Prof. HE, I knew almost nothing about research of eating behavior, and it was with the curiosity about the field that I joined this loving SCI-Cream lab. I still remember the day of the group meeting, we all gathered around Prof. HE and discussed the areas we could try. Prof. HE recommended the topic of intuitive eating intervention to me based on my experience in counseling and teacher internship. When I was first introduced to intuitive eating, I probably had similar thoughts to many others: "Isn't this another weight loss program?" However, after reading the textbook word by word, watching the creator's introductory video, and reviewing almost all of the prior research on intuitive eating, I realized that intuitive eating is so "warm"! During the experiment, I interviewed many friends and subjects, including myself, who had gone on diets, and perhaps tried diets, including many restrictive diets, which are an extremely "physically and mentally painful" process (high probability of weight regain, eating disorders, mood swings, etc.). If we don't trust our bodies, what are our chances of success, or even if we are "hurting" ourselves? So I'm grateful to have access to intuitive eating, with its concepts of "resist dieting", "learn to listen to your body", "work with food" ... and finally "accept yourself and love yourself". Yes, I think interventions are like education, treatment is not the ultimate goal, the ultimate goal is that you can all heal, grow, accept and love yourself in your own lives.

>I have been fortunate to have received a lot of help from many people, such as the help and support of my young fellows Xueyan and Chengyang, the advice and support of my parents and friends, and the active participation and feedback of all the subjects. I believe that every result of scientific research is quietly affecting the world, and it will be the efforts and achievements of all of us.

>Finally, thank you again for reading this article, and may you all smile, enjoy your food and enjoy your life.
