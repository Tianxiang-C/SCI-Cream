Abstract

Objective

Employing bibliometric methods, the present study aimed to map out the general landscape of existing research on eating disorders (EDs) over the past decades.

Method

Using the Web of Science database, we retrieved 41,917 research articles related to EDs published from 1981 to 2020. After removing those without an abstract, a total of 37,446 articles were retained. The study outlined the distribution of scholarship by time, languages, regions, and countries, and identified major research lines by applying latent topic modelling.

Results

Results revealed a general increasing trend in the number of publications on EDs research, and researchers from Western countries dominated the production of related scholarship. The distribution of published scholarship varied significantly by languages, regions, and countries. Seven main research topics emerged from past research (i.e., animal studies of food intake, risk factors and at-risk groups for eating disorders, body image in eating disorders, studies of cognition and brain in eating disorders, symptomatology and comorbidity of eating disorders, body weight and nutrition status in eating disorders, and treatment of eating disorders), with different topics showing unique research trends across the years.

Conclusions

This bibliometric analysis presents the most complete up-to-date overview on published research on EDs. While there is an increasing trend for EDs research, the available research evidence is generally from Western countries; thus, it is suggested that cooperation on EDs research should be strengthened between Western countries and other countries in the future.
