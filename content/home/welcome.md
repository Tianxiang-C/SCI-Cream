Welcome to the lab website! We aim to clarify the complex relationships between eating behaviors, body image, and media in the Chinese context. Both undergraduate and graduate students with a keen interest in health psychology are strongly encouraged to join our team. Don't hesitate to get in touch with Prof. HE Jinbo via [e-mail](mailto:hejinbo@cuhk.edu.cn) if interested!

You could also follow our WeChat official account (SCI CREAM) for first-hand information.
